)

# Returns comprehensive analysis with tool orchestration
# - Business readiness scoring
# - Funding opportunity matching  
# - Regulatory compliance check
# - Market research recommendations
```

    'sector': 'fintech',
    'team_size': 3,
    'location': 'Ghana',
    'mobile_first': True,
    'serves_rural_market': True
})

# Returns:
# - Overall readiness score (0-1)
# - Component breakdown (team, market, model, etc.)

     What problem does your business solve?"

User: "Mobile money for farmers in Ashanti"
Bot: "Great! Fintech for agriculture is promising in Ghana.
     How many people are in your team?"

User: "Just me so far"
Bot: "Assessment: Score 0.65/1.0
     Next step: Find a technical co-founder
     Relevant funding: TLcom, Partech Africa
     Want detailed funding info?"
```

### 3. Loan Risk Assessment
```python
# Ghana-adapted credit scoring
applicant_data = {
    'business_sector': 'agriculture',
    'location_type': 'rural',
    'gender': 'female',
    'mobile_money_history': True,
    'community_leader': True,
    'business_age_months': 24
}

risk_assessment = loan_scorer.score_loan_risk(applicant_data)
# Result: Low risk (0.75 score) with group lending recommendation
```

TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token_here
TWILIO_WHATSAPP_NUMBER=+14155238886

# Agent Configuration
USE_LANGCHAIN_AGENTS=true
AGENT_MAX_ITERATIONS=5
AGENT_TIMEOUT=120

```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Missing Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt --force-reinstall
```

**Environment Variables**
- Ensure OPENAI_API_KEY is set in .env file
- WhatsApp features require Twilio credentials
- Check API usage limits and billing

**Agent Workflows**
```bash
# Reset if agent workflows fail
python initialize_knowledge_base.py
```

**Performance Issues**
- Reduce AGENT_MAX_ITERATIONS for faster responses
- Lower MAX_RESPONSE_TOKENS for mobile optimization
- Use SSD storage for vector database

### Debug Mode
```bash
STREAMLIT_LOGGER_LEVEL=debug streamlit run app.py
